# Intro

This is a collection of repos and scripts designed to be able to easily boot up a set of services for docker containers. This is light on documentation for now as things stababilize. The best way to understand what's going on is to read the Makefiles/Dockerfiles in each directory.

If you want a quick start, try running make all and watch it start hadoop and spark containers for you.
